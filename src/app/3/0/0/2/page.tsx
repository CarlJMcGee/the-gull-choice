        You can feel the raw power radiating from the hard, pulsing wood.
        The tip glows, ready to burst, as the druid chants, "So shall you dance, so shall you be."
        When consciousness returns hours later, you find your once nimble and dexterous hands  have been
        replaced with claws. As you scuttle away, toward the setting sun, 
        you wonder in vain what the new future brings.`,
