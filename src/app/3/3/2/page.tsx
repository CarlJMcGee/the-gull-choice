      you thought all but gone from your life. It is only after a moment, you realize the sound is coming 
      from you. When you finish, you see the lone druid softly weaping to himself, wiping his tears
      off on his gull. "Thank you, my friend. I never thought I'd experience beauty like that again 
      after my wife passed. I now know the true meaning of Christmas." With a jolly laugh, he mounts 
      his gull and rockets into the night sky, fueled by the thin hope that there's still time 
      to save Christmas.`,
